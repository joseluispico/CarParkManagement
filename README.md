CarPark System Management - Web app written with PHP/JavaScript/HTML/CSS/JS/MAMP programming language to simulate a CarPark Management System. 

<strong><h1>Overview</h1></strong>

This project was designed as part of the subject System Design in my University. It provides admin and operators with abilities to register entry/exit of cars in a simulated CarPark I feel proud to make it public since it can help others. 

<strong><h1>Features</h1></strong>

Roles segregation: There are two dashboards, one for Operator roles and other for Admin roles. 

<strong>User Management</strong>: This feature is available only for admins and it allows them to view the list of users registered in the system as well as adding new user and deleting existing accounts.

<strong>CarPark slots Entry registration</strong: This feature is available for Operators and Administrators. It provides them with abilities to register car entries in the simulated car park. The Data required is a plac number, car model and whether is a car or a truck. Then, the system will register automatically the date/time in the database and generate a ticket to print. 
  
<strong> CarPark slot Exit registration</strong>: This functionality will allow both, admin and operators to register car exits by inputting the ticket number or the plac in case the customer has lost the ticket number. This will add a re-charge in their total payment amount in a printing receipt.
